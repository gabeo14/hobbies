            Chomp is a <em>Lampropeltis getula californiae</em>, more commonly known as a California Kingsnake. The genus
            name
            <em>Lampropeltis</em> means shiny shield, refering to the irridescent scales of all snakes in the genus. The
            common name kingsnake comes from the fact that they are known to eat other snakes, including rattlesnakes! They
            have a reputation of thinking everything is food. Can you tell why this one is named Chomp?

    These are my hobbies
  </h1>
  <p>I keep reptiles. I'm constantly gathering information about new species I'm interested in, as well as ones that I'm
    already experienced with. There's so much to know! Between my girlfriend and me , we have:
    <ul>
      <li>6 snakes</li>
      <li>4 lizards</li>
      <li>1 turtle</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>I also keep bugs! I'm not quite as interested in them as reptiles, but I still think they're really neat! I have:
    <ul>
      <li>2 Tarantulas</li>
      <li>1 scoprion</li>
      <li>4 beetles</li>
      <li>Several <em>hundred</em> roaches</li>
      <li>Several <em>THOUSAND</em> worms</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>On top of that, I have almost 200 plants!</p>
